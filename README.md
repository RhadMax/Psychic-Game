# Psychic-Game
This was the irst javascript homework assignment for UCSD Extension coding bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a site where the user is asked to take guesses at a letter of the alphabet chosen at random with each play. The user starts with 10 guesses and if the letter isn't guessed correctly they lose the game and may play again. The game will keep track of wins and losses. I chose to pay homage to a Sega Genesis title from my childhood with the theme I created, namely Shining Force II. I also made use of sound clips and music from the game which I was able to find online.
